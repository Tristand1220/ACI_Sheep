Our research investigates how individual sheep influence group dynamics by combining Arduino-based wearable sensors and computer vision. With our technology, we aim to identify leadership, environmental (temperature, weather, time of day), and communication factors (bleating, visual signals) that shape herding, and correlate retrieved data to understand how internal and external factors affect flock cohesion and leadership. Beyond data collection, our goal is to translate these insights and propose user experience solutions that help zookeepers monitor sheep behavior and patterns to detect early signs of stress or illness.

This research advances the field of Animal Computer Interaction by linking natural sheep behaviors to digital signals, and also addresses practical welfare applications. Wearable and vision-based monitoring can be converted into communication signals at the group level. This allows us to create scalable tools that benefit both agricultural practices and broader ACI research on multi-agent, nonverbal interaction. Additionally, this work supports livestock management by providing early, actionable insights. Since stressed or sick sheep often diverge from normal herding patterns, monitoring these deviations can help zookeepers, farmers, and researchers improve health outcomes and animal welfare.

Our M5 StickPlus-C displays tri axis, orientation, and time. If a distinct change in x or y axes occurs, it is deemed a “potential head swing event” (indicated by a red screen). If a distinct change in z-axis occurs, it is deemed a “potential head butt event” (indicated by a blue screen).
